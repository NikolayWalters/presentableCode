# Presentable Code

Welcome to the Presentable Code repository! This collection showcases a set of elegant scripts that demonstrate my coding skills. The repository is organized into three main folders: MLRelated, AstroRelated, and publishedFigures.

## MLRelated

The `MLRelated` folder contains scripts that are related to machine learning. These scripts demonstrate my proficiency in implementing machine learning algorithms and working with related libraries and frameworks. Each script is self-contained and focuses on a specific machine learning task or technique.

## AstroRelated

The `AstroRelated` folder contains scripts that are focused on astrophysical data analysis. These scripts highlight my ability to process and analyze astronomical datasets, as well as my familiarity with relevant astrophysics concepts and techniques. Each script in this folder showcases a specific aspect of astrophysical data analysis.

## publishedFigures

The `publishedFigures` folder contains scripts and PDF files of generated figures and plots. These figures have been published or are intended to demonstrate my plotting skills. Each script in this folder showcases different visualization techniques and styles, demonstrating my ability to effectively communicate data through visual representations.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the repository and dive into the folders that interest you. Each folder contains a variety of scripts that demonstrate different aspects of my coding skills. You can run the scripts in your local environment to see the results or refer to the PDF files in the `publishedFigures` folder to view the already generated figures.
